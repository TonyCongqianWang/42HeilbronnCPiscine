# C PISCINE AT 42 HEILBRONN

Here will be some projects I make during the 4 Week C Piscine at 42 Heilbronn. So far only the Rush01 Solution and a simpler version used for explaining is added. Every project has to satisfy [The Norm](https://github.com/MagicHatJo/-42-Norm/blob/master/norme.en.pdf) to be accepted. Thus there are restrictions like 5 function definitions per file and 5 local variables per function.

## SkyscraperSolver

So far only a Solver for the Skyscraper Puzzle is available. It supports 1x1 up to 9x9 puzzles. So for only constraint values are support and no grid values.
